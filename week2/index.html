            "my favorite place" is Toronto, just because this is where I grew up. I have great childhood memories here, and in the late 1990s/early 2000s, most of my family was in the process of immigrating to Canada. I have a lot of memories of meeting up with family in this city, meeting relatives for the first time here, and generally having a happy time growing up!

            "best vacation memories" is Puerto Vallerta, because this is the only vacation I got to take with both my immediate and extended family. I got to see cousins I hadn't been able to see in years, and I was also able to enjoy great food and branch outside of my comfort zone with zipling, scube diving, etc
